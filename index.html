            My name is Dickson Lee. I am a Web Developer with 2 years of experience in Front-end and 3 years as a Web
            Integrator. I am
            hobbyist photographer. I made this web page, with some inspiration, as a detailed journey in hope that you
            will find it interesting and engaging.

            While working at Turbulent, a digital media company, I had the opportunity to work with Ricardo Cuisine's
            graphic designers despite them being very particular, exigent and constantly aiming for pixel-perfect. This
            is
            when I was first exposed into the world of graphic and web design. One of my task and joy was to build and
            translate the mockup's design into a viewable web page. The following pictures is a sample of my work.

              Although, some new features were added since then. I had to make sure that the line height of the text are
              true to pixel value that was in the mockup. The symmetry of the text like how the words "Rustic Nectarine,
              Peach And Apricot Tart" is visually appealing since there isn't a single word on a single line.

            Plusgrade is a company that specializes in ancillary revenue in the travel business. For example, when you
            booked a ticket at an airline, the airline might send you an email asking whether you want to upgrade your
            seat level to a higher one (economy -> business). My role at Plusgrade was to help integrate new partners
            into
            our emails system, update pricing on certain routes and more importantly, help and consults clients
            about any customisation in their email template. Usually, the client provide us the necessary information
            but
            it can be challenging because using CSS in email is not the same in web browser. It has not evolve at the
            samne rate. Here is a sample email whom I had opportunity to work on.

            My latest work experience, pride and joy was at PPG Industries, a leading global company in the
            manufacturing
            of paint. My task was to revamp their main website (https://www.ppg.com/en-US) amd other sister websites
            base
            on mockup provided by the graphic designers. Anything in between the navigation bar to the footer, I had my
            hands on it. I added animation whenever a user is scrolling down the page, mouse hover effect on cards,
            dropdown menu, accordion that show their content or not etc. I truly felt value for my contribution when I
            was
            working with them unlike the first time at Ricardo Cuisine which added fuel to my curiosity about web design
            in general.

              We have seen many websites that animates while scrolling. But this website from the anime Obsolete made by
              Youtube is one that caught my attention. If you click on the "on" at the bottom left of the screen in
              desktop view, the website become interactive and becomes an interface UI where you are piloting a mech and
              you are shooting bullets on each mouse left-click while wearing a visor kinda like video game with Apple
              Vision Pro. I am big fan of Gundam, a animated Japanese military science fiction media franchise where
              giant robot or mechs is controlled by an ace pilot.

          5) Photography: personal piece
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, I am a hobbyist photographer. The first time I really held a camera was during my
            undergrad studies in Urban Studies at Concordia University. I had to take pictures of various buildings,
            described and understand its architectural design and its significance within the timeframe and how it might
            or not
            persevere throughout the time. Rather than using a camera phone producing low quality pictures, I decided to
            buy a Fujifilm x100. Yes, the same camera line that TikTok made popular and scalpers are into it. Alas, I
            digress. So from there own, I decided to photography more seriously and understand the inner works such as
            composition, f-stop and know when to under or over expose a shot. Here are some of my creation:
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="two-images">
          <div class="two-images-div">
            <p>
              I was really inspired by Julia aka
              <strong><a target="__blank"
                  href="https://www.instagram.com/naturey_moments/?hl=en">naturey_moments</a></strong> in Instagram. The
              picture that I took was edited in Lightroom. My goal was to somehow achieve Wes Anderson's signature
              pastel
              vibrance in his works such as the movie Budapest.
            </p>
          </div>
          <figure>
            <img class="two-images-img" src="/hana2.jpg" placeholder="flower" />
          </figure>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="two-images">
          <figure>
            <img class="two-images-img" src="/hana1.jpg" placeholder="flower" />
          </figure>
          <div class="two-images-div">
            <p>
              This one is also inspired by Julia but rather than achieving the pastel look. I wanted to maintain as much
              details in the petals but also make the color pop as much as possible.
